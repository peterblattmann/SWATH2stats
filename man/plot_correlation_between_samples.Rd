\title{Plots the correlation between injections.}
\usage{
plot_correlation_between_samples(data, column.values = "intensity",
  size = 6, comparison = transition_group_id ~ condition + bioreplicate,
  fun.aggregate = NULL, label = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame that is produced by the OpenSWATH/pyProphet workflow.}

\item{column.values}{Indicates the columns for which the correlation is
assessed. This can be the Intensity or Signal, but also the retention
time.}

\item{size}{How large should the text in the grid be (smaller is better for
rmarkdown html reports).}

\item{comparison}{The comparison for assessing the variability. Default is
to assess the variability per transition_group_id over the different
Condition and Replicates. Comparison is performed using the dcast()
function of the reshape2 package.}

\item{fun.aggregate}{If for the comparison values have to be aggregated one
needs to provide the function here.}

\item{label}{Option to print correlation value in the plot.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
Plots in Rconsole a correlation heatmap and returns the data frame
  used to do the plotting.
}
\description{
This function plots the Pearson's and Spearman correlation between
samples. If decoys are present these are removed before plotting.
