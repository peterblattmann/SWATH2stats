\title{Filter openSWATH output for proteins that are identified by a minimum of n independent peptides.}
\usage{
filter_on_min_peptides(data, n_peptides = 6, rm.decoy = TRUE,
  column = "proteinname")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data table that is produced by the openSWATH/iPortal workflow.}

\item{n_peptides}{Number of minimal number of peptide IDs associated with a
protein ID in order to be kept in the dataset.}

\item{rm.decoy}{Option to remove the decoys during filtering.}

\item{column}{which column to use for filtering?}
}
\value{
Returns the filtered data frame with only peptides that map to
  proteins with >= n_peptides peptides.
}
\description{
This function removes entries mapping to proteins that are identified by less
than n_peptides.
Removing single-hit proteins from an analysis can significantly increase the
sensitivity under strict protein fdr criteria, as evaluated by
e.g. assess_fdr_overall.
