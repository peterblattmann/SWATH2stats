\title{Plot functionality for results of class "fdr_table" as produced by e.g. the function assess_fdr_overall()}
\usage{
plot_fdr_table(x, output = "Rconsole", filename = "FDR_report_overall", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List of class "fdr_table" as produced e.g. by the function
assess_fdr_overall() from this package.}

\item{output}{Choose output type. "pdf_csv" creates the output as files in
the working directory, "Rconsole" triggers delivery of the output to the
console enabling further computation or custom plotting / output.}

\item{filename}{Basename for output files to be created (if output =
"pdf_csv" has been selected).}

\item{...}{Extra arguments passed on to functions inside this.}
}
\value{
Originally this returned nothing, but now it makes a list of ggplot2
  plots which may be passed along and plotted as desired (with that in mind,
  I would like to remove the explicit plot() calls in this function).
}
\description{
This function created standard plots from results of class "fdr_table" as
produced by e.g. the function assess_fdr_overall() visualizig ID numbers in
dependence of estimated FDR and also estimated FDR in dependence of m_score
cutoff.
