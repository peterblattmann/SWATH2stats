\title{Writes out an overview matrix of summed signals per protein identifier
(lines) over run_id(columns).}
\usage{
write_matrix_proteins(data, write.csv = FALSE, fun.aggregate = sum,
  filename = "SWATH2stats_overview_matrix_proteinlevel.csv",
  rm.decoy = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing annotated OpenSWATH/pyProphet data.}

\item{write.csv}{Option to determine if table should be written automatically into csv file.}

\item{fun.aggregate}{What function to use when aggregating the set of intensities?}

\item{filename}{File base name of the .csv matrix written out to the working
folder}

\item{rm.decoy}{Logical whether decoys will be removed from the data
matrix. Defaults to FALSE. It's sometimes useful to know how decoys behave
across a dataset and how many you allow into your final table with the
current filtering strategy.}
}
\value{
the peptides as a matrix, also output .csv matrix is written to the
  working folder
}
\description{
Writes out an overview matrix on protein level of a supplied (unfiltered or
filtered) OpenSWATH results data frame. The protein quantification is achieved
by summing the areas under all 6 transitions per precursor, summing all
precursors per FullPeptideName and all FullPeptideName signals per
ProteinName entry.
This function does not select consistently quantified or top peptides but
sums all signals availabe that may or may not originate from the same set of
peptides across different runs. A more detailed overview can be generated
using the function write_matrix_peptides().
Peptide selection can be achieved upstream using e.g. the functions
filter_mscore_requant(), filter_on_max_peptides() and
filter_on_min_peptides().
