\title{Filter annotated OpenSWATH/pyProphet output table to achieve a high FDR
quality data matrix with controlled overall protein FDR and quantitative
values for all peptides mapping to these high-confidence proteins (up to a
desired overall peptide level FDR quality).}
\usage{
filter_mscore_fdr(data, FFT = 1, overall_protein_fdr_target = 0.02,
  mscore_limit = 0.01, upper_overall_peptide_fdr_limit = 0.05,
  rm.decoy = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Annotated OpenSWATH/pyProphet data table.}

\item{FFT}{Ratio of false positives to true negatives, q-values from
[Injection_name]_full_stat.csv in pyProphet stats output. As an
approximation, the q-values of multiple runs are averaged and supplied as
argument FFT. Numeric from 0 to 1. Defaults to 1, the most conservative
value (1 Decoy indicates 1 False target). For further details see the
Vignette Section 1.3 and 4.1.}

\item{overall_protein_fdr_target}{FDR target for the protein master list for
which quantitative values down to the less strict peptide_fdr criterion
will be kept/reported. Defaults to 0.02.}

\item{mscore_limit}{FDR target for the quantitative values kept/reported for
all peptides mapping to the high-confidence protein master list. Defaults
to 0.05. If all values up to m_score 0.01 shall be kept, set = 1.}

\item{rm.decoy}{Logical T/F, whether decoy entries should be removed after
the analysis. Defaults to TRUE. Can be useful to disable to track the
influence on decoy fraction by further filtering steps such as requiring 2
peptides per protein.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the filtered data.

\description{
This function controls the protein FDR over a multi-run OpenSWATH/pyProphet
output table and filters all quantitative values to a desired overall/global
peptide FDR level.
It first finds a suitable m-score cutoff to minimally achieve a desired
global FDR quality on a protein master list based on the function
mscore4protfdr. It then finds a suitable m-score cutoff to minimally achieve
a desired global FDR quality on peptide level based on the function
mscore4pepfdr. Finally, it reports all the peptide quantities derived based
on the peptide level cutoff for only those peptides mapping to the protein
master list. It further summarizes the protein and peptide numbers remaining
after the filtering and evaluates the individual run FDR qualities of the
peptides (and quantitation events) selected.
