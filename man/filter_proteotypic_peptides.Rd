\title{Filter for proteins that are supported by proteotypic peptides.}
\usage{
filter_proteotypic_peptides(data, rm.decoy = TRUE,
  column = "proteinname")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing SWATH data.}

\item{rm.decoy}{Option to remove the decoys during filtering.}

\item{column}{Which column to query for filtering?}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with only the data supported by proteotypic
  peptides.
}
\description{
Peptides can match to several proteins. With this function proteotypic
peptides, peptides that are only contained in one protein are
selected. Additionally the number of proteins are counted and printed.
